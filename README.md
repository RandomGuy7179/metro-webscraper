# metro-webscraper

In this project I wanted to webscrape metropolitan information of a city from [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org). I used pandas to read in a table with a "City" and "State" column and Selenium to perform the webscraping. The python code gets a unique list of cities and their states and runs them through the webscraper. For every city and state in the unique list, the webscraper goes to https://censusreporter.org, searches for the location, goes to the webpage of the location, and extracts the metropolitan area. The code then returns a copy of the table inputed with the addition of a "Metro Area" column that stores metropolitan area for every city and state in the dataset that was found on census reporter. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/RandomGuy7179/metro-webscraper/blob/main/Current_Census_webscraper%20(2).ipynb)
